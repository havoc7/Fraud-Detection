A general outline for fraud detection model building is proposed, encompassing data preprocessing, feature engineering, data splitting, model selection, model training, model evaluation, 
imbalanced data handling, ensemble methods, threshold optimization, monitoring and updating, explainability and interpretability, and compliance and security.
